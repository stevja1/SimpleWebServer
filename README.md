# SimpleWebServer
A simple web server written in Java 8. This was written as part of a programming exercise that I did once.

To compile:
```$ mvn clean package```

To run:
```$ java -jar target/WebServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar server_config.json```

The default server config starts a server on localhost on port 4444. To test, go to http://localhost:4444.
